        This website can accept any YouTube video, listed or unlisted, to show to 
        trainees. Listed videos show up in YouTube searches and suggestions, unlisted
        videos don't. They are only visible to people who already have a link to it. 
        <strong>This does not mean they are private</strong>; anybody with the link 
        (including everyone who has access to this website) can share it freely. It's 
        even possible to randomly discover an unlisted video by trial and error. There 
        are services available, such as vimeo, which offer truly private video hosting, 
        but not for free. 
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">
        You can add existing youtube videos, or you can upload your own. You'll need a 
        Google account, and pay attention to privacy settings before you publish 
        the video if you'd like to set it as unlisted. There is more help 
        <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/57407?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en">here</a>
        if you need it.
