      <p class="card-text">This site is under active development; currently it's very barebones and likely to break as I update and change things. There are some important things to know about using it in its current state: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>There is no SSL encryption (https://) yet, which means that any information sent between your computer and the webserver can be read by people in between. The biggest threat here is public wifi, so I'd advise you only access it from wifi networks which have a password, and where you know everyone on them (<i>especially</i> if you are a trainer or  an administrator). Once I get security certificates enabled, this will no longer be a problem.</li>
      </ul>
    <p class="card-text">Please understand that I'm building this site on a volunteer basis, during my free time, while working another job and preparing for a very out-of-town move. I'll get to things as quickly as I can, but it might take a few days or weeks! I'd love to hear feedback; if something is inconvenient, or could be presented better, or if there are any other changes you'd like to see please tell me! (ESPECIALLY contact me if you're running into error messages.) <a href="mailto:rbuchberger@gmail.com">rbuchberger@gmail.com</a></p>
