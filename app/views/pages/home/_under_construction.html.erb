    <p class="card-text">This site is under active development; currently it's very barebones and likely to break as I update and change things.</p>
    <p>There is no SSL encryption (https://) yet, which means that any information sent between your computer and the webserver can be read by people in between. The biggest threat here is public wifi, so I'd advise you only access it from wifi networks which have a password, and where you know everyone on them (<i>especially</i> if you are a trainer or an administrator).</p>
