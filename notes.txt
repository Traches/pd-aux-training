--- instructions output from generate devise:install

Some setup you must do manually if you haven't yet:

  1. Ensure you have defined default url options in your environments files. Here
     is an example of default_url_options appropriate for a development environment
     in config/environments/development.rb:

       config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { host: 'localhost', port: 3000 }

     In production, :host should be set to the actual host of your application.

-- "timecard" is one word, for the purposes of this application. Not TimeCard or time_card
-- Time is looking to be more complicated than I thought. Database will save times in UTC, 
  will convert to EST in the controller/view. Apparently this is done automatically by 
  activerecord. App time zone is set to eastern time, cause that's where everyone's at.  



Don't forget!: 


-Generally reduce database calls 
-Configure secrets.yml, make sure production encryption keys aren't on github!

-Application level user logged in checking
-prevent bot spamming of the signup box (captcha?)
-Sort users index alphabetically by last name
-Set up tables to truncate long bits of text. 
-Make sure the last admin can't delete their account. 
-Validation/verification for users controller (don't assume everything succeeds)
-Need to format devise error messages
-strftime dates on the user show page
-Capitalize names before save to database

-User validations: 
  -Badge number must follow proper format (need to ask Dad what that is)

-Timecards to do:
  -Set up admin interface. Need a way to see all timecards in a given date range 
   
- Stuff to ask dad:
  -Badge number format? 
  -Ok to have descriptionless timecards?
  -Shortest day worth logging? 

Low priority: 
-Looks like everything breaks if app tries to save/update something that's locked
  in a transaction. 
-Working close button on flash messages?
-Maybe change Timecard.end to Timecard.finish? "end" keeps turning purple, and it bothers me.
-Super trooper references should probably be removed before it goes live.
