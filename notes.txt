--- instructions output from generate devise:install

Some setup you must do manually if you haven't yet:

  1. Ensure you have defined default url options in your environments files. Here
     is an example of default_url_options appropriate for a development environment
     in config/environments/development.rb:

       config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { host: 'localhost', port: 3000 }

     In production, :host should be set to the actual host of your application.


Also to do: 

-config users to be lockable

-Make sure it's not pinging the database for every single page load. Store userdata in session? 
-Need to format devise error messages
-Make sure the last admin can't delete their account. 
-validation for badge number
-Some way to prevent bot spamming of the signup box
-Validation/verification for users controller (don't assume everything succeeds)
-Working close button on flash messages
