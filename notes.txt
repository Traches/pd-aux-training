--- instructions output from generate devise:install

Some setup you must do manually if you haven't yet:

  1. Ensure you have defined default url options in your environments files. Here
     is an example of default_url_options appropriate for a development environment
     in config/environments/development.rb:

       config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { host: 'localhost', port: 3000 }

     In production, :host should be set to the actual host of your application.


Also to do: 

-config users to be lockable
https://github.com/plataformatec/devise/wiki/How-To:-Add-:lockable-to-Users

-Change link_to tags to button_to for post and destroy actions in the admin interface
-Super trooper references should probably be removed before it goes live. 
-Make sure it's not pinging the database for every single page load. Store userdata in session? 
-Need to format devise error messages
-Make sure the last admin can't delete their account. 
-Account update (where users edit their own profile) isn't working. Probably need to whitelist some parameters. 
-Shield icon keeps disappearing?
