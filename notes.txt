--- instructions output from generate devise:install

Some setup you must do manually if you haven't yet:

  1. Ensure you have defined default url options in your environments files. Here
     is an example of default_url_options appropriate for a development environment
     in config/environments/development.rb:

       config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { host: 'localhost', port: 3000 }

     In production, :host should be set to the actual host of your application.

-- "timecard" is one word, for the purposes of this application. Not TimeCard or time_card
-- Time is looking to be more complicated than I thought. Database will save times in UTC, 
  will convert to EST in the controller/view. Apparently this is done automatically by 
  activerecord. App time zone is set to eastern time, cause that's where everyone's at.  



Also to do: 

-config users to be lockable
https://github.com/plataformatec/devise/wiki/How-To:-Add-:lockable-to-Users

-Super trooper references should probably be removed before it goes live. 
-Generally reduce database calls 
-Need to format devise error messages
-Make sure the last admin can't delete their account. 
-Some way to prevent bot spamming of the signup box
-Validation/verification for users and timecards controller (don't assume everything succeeds)
-Working close button on flash messages
-Configure secrets.yml, make sure production encryption keys aren't on github!
-Add flash messages to everything
-Set up tables to truncate long bits of text
-Check for logged in on all controllers

Validations:
-Timecards:
 -No overlapping timecards
 -Start has to come before end
 -Reasonable length limit (No more than 16 hours?)
 -Can't set times in the future? No more than a day in the future?

-Users: 
  -Reasonable length limits on names
  -Email must be an email address. 
  -Badge number must follow proper format (need to ask Dad what that is)
  -Application level user logged in checking
  
-Timecards to do:
  -Build the show page
  -Bootstrap the create & edit forms
  -Moar bootstrap the index page
  -Index page needs a way of selecting a date range
  -Set up admin interface. Need a way to see all timecards in a given date range 
  -Maybe change Timecard.end to Timecard.finish? "end" keeps turning purple, and it bothers me. 
  -Add "edit" button to the "show" page
  -Needs a "name" column when viewing all users
  
  -Split up the admin timecards index from the regular user timecard index. You're
    doing to many weird things just to avoid having another controller action.
