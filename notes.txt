--- instructions output from generate devise:install

Some setup you must do manually if you haven't yet:

  1. Ensure you have defined default url options in your environments files. Here
     is an example of default_url_options appropriate for a development environment
     in config/environments/development.rb:

       config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { host: 'localhost', port: 3000 }

     In production, :host should be set to the actual host of your application.

Don't forget!
 
-Need to format devise error messages
-about page
-Stuff to ask dad:
-Account details page looks bad on anything but a wide screen. 

  -Badge number format? Should they be unique?
  -Ok to have descriptionless timecards?
  -Shortest workday worth logging? 
  -Default dates for displaying timecards - 30 days ago, this calendar month, 
    last calendar month, this year, etc? 

Low priority (worry about once everything works without exploding): 
-Looks like everything breaks if app tries to save/update something that's locked
  in a transaction. 
-Working close button on flash messages?
-Maybe rename timecard start and finish? "end" keeps turning purple, and it bothers me.
-Super trooper references should probably be removed before it goes live. 
-Stop table headers from highlighting on mouseover
-better default values for logging timecards. Also, only minute multiples of 15
-Generally reduce database calls 
-Configure secrets.yml, make sure production encryption keys aren't on github!
-prevent bot spamming of the signup box (captcha?)
-Capitalize names before save to database
-Make sure the last admin can't delete their account.
-Proper possesivising of people's names. (There's a gem for it)
-add a full name method to users
-add a trainer or admin method to users
-don't redirect to users_path when you accept or reject
