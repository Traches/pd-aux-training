--- Don't forget!
 
-Need to format devise error messages

-Account details page looks bad on anything but a wide screen. 
-Implement soft-delete of users
-Truncate name in navbar
-Long names in titles break mobile. Overflow? 


--- Questions and answers: 

-Badge number format? Should they be unique? --- No. X-01 through X-15, and 700 numbers. 
-Shortest workday worth logging? -- 30 minutes. 
-Default dates for displaying timecards -- Past thirty days. 
  
  
  
--- Low priority (worry about once everything works without exploding): 
-Looks like everything breaks if app tries to save/update something that's locked
  in a transaction. (Can test by starting a sandbox console)
-Working close button on flash messages?
-Maybe rename timecard start and finish? "end" keeps turning purple, and it bothers me.
-Super trooper references should probably be removed before it goes live. 
-Stop table headers from highlighting on mouseover
-better default values for logging timecards. Also, only minute multiples of 15
-Generally reduce database calls 
-Configure secrets.yml, make sure production encryption keys aren't on github!
-prevent bot spamming of the signup box (captcha?)
-Capitalize names before save to database
-Make sure the last admin can't delete their account.
-Proper possesivising of people's names. (There's a gem for it)
-add a full name method to users
-add a trainer or admin method to users
-don't redirect to users_path when you accept or reject
-about page, readme, gitignore, church it up for portfolio
-client side validation of all forms

Some setup you must do manually if you haven't yet:

  1. Ensure you have defined default url options in your environments files. Here
     is an example of default_url_options appropriate for a development environment
     in config/environments/development.rb:

       config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { host: 'localhost', port: 3000 }

     In production, :host should be set to the actual host of your application.
