--- TODO before release:
 
-Implement soft-delete of users. Better routing (under 'member') for approve and reject actions
-Mailer config
-Account details page looks bad on anything but a wide screen. Generally check for 
  mobile friendliness. 
-Super trooper references should probably be removed before it goes live. 
-Configure secrets.yml, make sure production encryption keys aren't on github!
-client side validation of all forms
-Detailed instructions on admin pages
-User name validation with regex (UTF-8 characters only, no numbers, spaces.)
-stop using things like current_user.trainer? in your views. Switch to policies
-Link from user#training videos to user details
-link from training video#users to video
-categorize users index


--- Before publishing this round
 -log workday form needs love

--- Finish after first deployment
-Test youtube regular expression grabber more thoroughly
-Format devise error messages
-Looks like everything breaks if app tries to save/update something that's locked
  in a transaction. (Can test by starting a sandbox console)
-Working close button on flash messages?
-Maybe rename timecard start and finish? "end" keeps turning purple, and it bothers me.
-better default values for logging timecards. Also, only minute multiples of 15
-Generally reduce database calls 
-prevent bot spamming of the signup box (captcha?)
-Make sure the last admin can't delete their account.
-don't redirect to users_path when you accept or reject from homepage
-about page, readme, gitignore, church it up for portfolio
-Learn about rails autoloading and importing modules from other files
-Learn testing and write them
-Long names in titles break mobile. Overflow? 
-Make all cells in table rows links as well. 
-Leave video title and description blank to pull from youtube
-Custom start and end times

--- Questions and answers: 

-Badge number format? Should they be unique? --- No. X-01 through X-15, and 700 numbers. 
-Shortest workday worth logging? -- 30 minutes.

Some setup you must do manually if you haven't yet:

  1. Ensure you have defined default url options in your environments files. Here
     is an example of default_url_options appropriate for a development environment
     in config/environments/development.rb:

       config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { host: 'localhost', port: 3000 }

     In production, :host should be set to the actual host of your application.

Idea scratchpad
--Category dropdown (4 or 5 options plus "other") for timecards? 
--Add timecard and training completion list to user show page
  -- route timecards under users? Maybe there's a better way to do your routing
    and avoid needing an admindex custom action
--Youtube playlist support?
