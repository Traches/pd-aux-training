# This is a quick and dirty backup script. It creates and downloads a backup on heroku, encrypts it,
# and uploads it to an S3 bucket.

# You need both AWS and Heroku installed and configured, as well as the public key you'd like to use
# to encrypt. 

# For convenience, create the following link to add it to the path, while keeping it in this repo:
# ln mtns-backup ~/bin/mtns-backup

# Set where we'll keep the file (temporarily)
output_location="$HOME/production_db_$(date -u +"%y-%m-%d_%H%M").dump"

# Create backup
heroku pg:backups:capture --app mtns-aux-production

# Download the backup
heroku pg:backups:download --output $output_location --app mtns-aux-production 

# Encrypt the file:
if [ -e $output_location ]; then
  echo "File successfuly downloaded"
  gpg --output="$output_location.gpg" \
    --recipient robert@robert-buchberger.com \
    --encrypt $output_location
else
  echo "Did not successfully download file. Terminating."
  exit 1
fi

# Upload to AWS
if [ -e $output_location.gpg ]; then
  echo "Successfully Downloaded backup"
  aws s3 cp $output_location.gpg s3://mtns-aux-officer-tools/db_backups/
else
  echo "Did not successfully encrypt file. Terminating."
fi

# Destroy the evidence
rm $output_location $output_location.gpg
